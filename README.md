<b>Coding Circuit Rating System</b>

This project implements a simulation of a competitive coding rating system for a series of events called the **"Coding Circuit"**. Participantsâ€™ ratings dynamically evolve after each event based on performance, contest difficulty, and inactivity.

<b>Files</b>

- 'Participant_details.csv' â€“ Contains participant numbers and a list of events each participated in.
- 'event_weights.csv' â€“ Contains each eventâ€™s number, difficulty (1=Easy, 2=Medium, 3=Hard), and weight.
- 'rating_history.csv' â€“ Output file showing participant ratings after every event (even skipped ones).
- 'final_leaderboard.csv' â€“ Sorted list of final participant ratings.
- 'ccrs.py' â€“ The main Python script that performs the simulation.

<b>Features</b>

- 6 problems per contest; difficulty determines expected solve rate.
- Dynamic rating updates based on expected vs actual performance.
- Contest 'weight factor' scales the rating impact.
- 'Decay system' for participants who miss 2+ events in a row.
- Flexible rating adjustments in early stages (first two contests).
- Biased random generation for simulating real-world solving ability.

<b>Rating System</b>

- **Initial Rating:** 1000 (minimum rating = 1000)
- **Expected Problems Solved (Î¼):**  
  \[
  \Î¼(R) = \frac{6}{1 + 10^{(R_{mid} - R)/400}}
  \]  
  where Rmid depends on contest difficulty:
  - Easy (1): Rmid = 1400  
  - Medium (2): Rmid = 1500  
  - Hard (3): Rmid = 1600
- **Actual Problems Solved (S):** Generated using a biased distribution.
- **Rating Update Formula:**  
  \[
  \Delta = K \cdot (S - \mu) \cdot \text{weight}
  \]  
  where K = 40 for <3 events, otherwise K = 20.

## ðŸŽ² Biased Problem Solving

| Rating Range   | Likely Problems Solved       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| <1300          | 1 or 2 (highly likely)         |
| 1300â€“1500      | 3 (most likely)                |
| 1500â€“1800      | 4 or 5 (most likely)           |
| 1800+          | 6 (most likely)                |

Random values are chosen with weighted bias to simulate realistic performance tendencies.

## ðŸ“‰ Inactivity & Decay

If a participant misses **2+ consecutive events**, their rating decays:
- **Decay Formula:** 5% of the amount above 1000 (capped at 50 points).
- Applied only when a 2-event gap is detected between participations.

---

## ðŸ“Š Output Files

- **rating_history.csv**  
  Ratings of every participant **after each event** (even if they didnâ€™t participate, rating is carried forward or decayed).
  
- **final_leaderboard.csv**  
  Final ratings, sorted from highest to lowest.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
2. Install required package (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Place both CSV input files in the same directory as `main.py`.
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. Check the generated files: `rating_history.csv` and `final_leaderboard.csv`.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All ratings are rounded to the nearest integer.
- Decay is applied before event participation if the inactivity condition is met.
- The simulation ensures a fair and dynamic rating evolution based on real-world contest behavior.
